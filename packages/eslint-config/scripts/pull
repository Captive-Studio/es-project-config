##
# This script synchronize rules directory with @w5s/eslint-config
# It is an open source repository maintained by Julien Polo
#
#
# Tradeoffs of this solutions :
# Advantages
# - Captive still have its ownership of the repository: every rule is explicit in its configuration
# - Captive can disable the sync script if there is a problem with @w5s/eslint-config
#
# Drawbacks
# - When pulling changes, semantic versioning information is lost (breaking changes, etc)
